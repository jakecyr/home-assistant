- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run build` - Rebuild after making changes
- `./scripts/run.sh` - Run with auto-restart on crashes

#### Configuration
Customize the assistant by creating a `config.json` file. See the example below for available options.

## üéôÔ∏è Audio Setup

To list available audio devices:
```bash
node scripts/list-audio-devices.js
```

Set `AUDIO_DEVICE` in `.env` to the desired device index or name.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

| `SERPAPI_KEY`          | ‚¨úÔ∏è      | Required for web search             | ‚Äì             |

### Config File

Create a `config.json` file to customize device mappings and enable features:

```json
{
  "tools": ["tplink_toggle", "time_now", "weather_current", "web_search"],
  "tplink": {
    "devices": {
      "living_room_plug": {
        "ip": "192.168.1.42",
        "room": "living room",
        "aliases": ["couch plug"]
      }
    }
  },
  "weather": {
    "latitude": 47.6062,
    "longitude": -122.3321,
    "units": "imperial",
    "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"
  }
}
```

#### Auto-Discovery

Discover TP-Link devices automatically:
```bash
node scripts/scan-tplink.js --write
node scripts/setup-weather.js --write
```


2. **AssemblyAI**
   - Get a key from [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com/)
   - Set as `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY`

3. **OpenAI**
   - Get a key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
   - Set as `OPENAI_API_KEY`

## üñ•Ô∏è Platform Setup

### Raspberry Pi (Recommended)

```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git build-essential python3 make g++ alsa-utils
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs

# Follow the Quick Start instructions above
```

### macOS
1. Install Node.js 20: `brew install node@20`
2. Grant microphone access in System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Microphone
3. Follow the Quick Start instructions

### Windows
1. Install Node.js 20 from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Run PowerShell as Administrator and execute the Quick Start steps
3. Allow microphone access when prompted
3. **Configure audio**
   - Run `arecord -l` to verify the microphone shows up. Note the card/device numbers.
   - Use the [device listing command](#listing-audio-devices) or set `AUDIO_DEVICE` to the matching index/label in `.env` (leave as `default` if ALSA default is correct).
4. **Provide secrets**
   - Add your Picovoice, AssemblyAI, and OpenAI keys to `.env`.
5. **Build and run**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```
   Keep the terminal open; the assistant logs status transitions (IDLE ‚Üí LISTENING ‚Üí THINKING) as audio flows. Replies are spoken out loud when a supported player (`aplay`, `paplay`, `ffplay`, or `play`) is installed.
6. **(Optional) Keep it running**
   - Use `tmux`, `screen`, or a process manager like `pm2` to keep the assistant alive after logout.
   - Configure your Pi's audio output (e.g., `raspi-config` ‚Üí System Options ‚Üí Audio) if you want spoken responses through speakers.

## Extending the assistant

- Add new tool files to `src/tools` that implement the `Tool` interface and export `name`, `description`, `parameters`, and `execute`.
- Re-run `npm run build` after adding or editing TypeScript files.
- Update downstream hardware integrations (e.g., replace the placeholder lighting code with real GPIO or smart-home API calls).
- Provide config-driven lookups via `loadConfig` (see `src/config.ts`) if your tools need user-defined settings.
- Review the built-in tools (`tplink_toggle`, `weather_current`, `time_now`, `web_search`) for examples of network calls, configuration access, and environment secrets.

## Troubleshooting tips

- **Wake word not triggering:** Double-check that the Porcupine access key is valid and that the microphone is routed to the selected device index.
- **No transcript:** Ensure the AssemblyAI key has real-time access and that outbound `wss://` traffic is allowed by your firewall.
- **Model refuses tool calls:** Confirm `OPENAI_MODEL` names a tool-capable model and that the tool schema matches the arguments you expect.
- **Volume too low on Raspberry PI:** The volume can be increased by running the command `amixer sset Master 90%` with the desired volume percentage.
